## Problem 1

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


```{r}


trash_data = read_excel("./data/HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2018-7-28.xlsx", sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel", range = cell_cols("A:N"), 
                        col_names = TRUE, skip = 1) %>%
                        janitor::clean_names() %>%
                        na.omit()
# omit rows that do not include dumpster-specific data


# round the number of sports balls to the nearest integer
trash_data$sports_balls = as.integer(round(trash_data$sports_balls))

```

```{r}

# read and clean precipitation data for 2017 and 2018
precip_data_2017 = read_excel("./data/HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2018-7-28.xlsx", sheet = "2017 Precipitation", col_names = TRUE, skip = 1) %>%
                              janitor::clean_names() %>%
                              na.omit() %>%
                              mutate(year = 2017)
 
precip_data_2018 = read_excel("./data/HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2018-7-28.xlsx", sheet = "2018 Precipitation", col_names = TRUE, skip = 1) %>%
                              janitor::clean_names() %>%
                              na.omit() %>%
                              mutate(year = 2018)

# combine the two datasets
precip_data = full_join(precip_data_2017, precip_data_2018, by = NULL) %>%
                        mutate(month = month.name[month])
```
You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
